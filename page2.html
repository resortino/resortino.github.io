But people who lose weight gradually and steadily (about 1 to 2 pounds per week) are more successful at keeping weight off. Healthy weight loss isn&rsquo;t just about a &ldquo;diet&rdquo; or &ldquo;program&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s about an ongoing lifestyle that includes long-term changes in daily eating and exercise habits.</p> <p> Once you&rsquo;ve achieved a healthy weight, rely on healthy eating and physical activity to help you keep the weight off over the long term.</p> <p> Losing weight is not easy, and it takes commitment. But if you&rsquo;re ready to get started , we&rsquo;ve got a step-by-step guide to help get you on the road to weight loss and better health.</p> <h2> Even modest weight loss can mean big benefits</h2> <p> Even a modest weight loss of 5 to 10 percent of your total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars. 1 </p> <p> For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, a 5 percent weight loss equals 10 pounds, bringing your weight down to 190 pounds. While this weight may still be in the &ldquo;overweight&rdquo; or &ldquo;obese&rdquo; range, this modest weight loss can decrease your risk factors for chronic diseases related to obesity.</p> <p> So even if the overall goal seems large, see it as a journey rather than just a final destination. You&rsquo;ll learn new eating and physical activity habits that will help you live a healthier lifestyle. These habits may help you maintain your weight loss over time.</p> <p> For example, the National Weight Control Registry<span> external icon</span> <span> </span> noted that study participants who maintained a significant weight loss reported improvements in physical health as well as energy levels, physical mobility, general mood, and self-confidence.</p> Top of Page <span> </span> Want to learn more? <p> <strong> Getting Started</strong> <strong> <br> </strong> Check out our step-by-step guide to help you get on the road to weight loss and better health.</p> <p> <strong> Improving Your Eating Habits</strong> <strong> <br> </strong> Your eating habits may be leading to weight gain; for example, eating too fast, always clearing your plate, eating when you are not hungry and skipping meals (or maybe just breakfast).</p> <p> <strong> Keeping the Weight Off</strong> <strong> <br> </strong> Losing weight is the first step. Once you&rsquo;ve lost weight, you&rsquo;ll want to learn how to keep it off.</p> <h4> References</h4> <p> 1 Reference for 5%: Blackburn G. (1995). Effect of degree of weight loss on health benefits.
